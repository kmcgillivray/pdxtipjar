    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      With a government mandate in effect as of Tuesday, March 17th, all bars
      &amp; restaurants in the state of Wisconsin are required to close for the
      next four weeks, with the exception of take-out and delivery operations.
      We don't truly know how long this will last &amp; what the lasting
      economic impact will be for service industry workers. We're following the
      examples of Portland, DC, Pittsburgh, &amp; Indianapolis by starting a Virtual Tip
      Jar.

      If you'd like to support our Northeast Wisconsin service industry workers during
      these uncertain--and very stressful--times, We're compiling a list of cooks,
      bartenders, servers, baristas, dishwashers, &amp; other essential folks
      who keep our community's food &amp; beverage culture thriving. A small
      contribution can help these folks stay afloat financially while we wait to
      see what develops in the coming weeks.
